**Only open new issues if you have found a genuine issue in one of the projects (such as SaveEdit).**

**[Questions, comments, etc, should be directed to me via Twitter](http://twitter.com/gibbed/).**

[Otherwise, you can view existing issues or submit new ones on the issues list](http://code.google.com/p/me3tools/issues/list).
